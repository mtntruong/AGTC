# AGTC
Source code and data for the paper  
Attention-Guided Low-Rank Tensor Completion  
Truong Thanh Nhat Mai, Edmund Y. Lam, and Chul Lee

If you have any question, please open an issue.  
The algorithm can also be applied to other applications. Please feel free to ask if you need help with training the algorithm using other datasets.

# Source code
The proposed algorithm is implemented in Python using PyTorch 1.11.  
Please note that the source codes have not been refactored yet, so they are a little ugly.  
I will try to improve the readability and quality of this repository over time. I have been a bit busy recently due to company work.  
The training/testing scripts of AGTC is similar to those of [LRT-HDR](https://github.com/mtntruong/LRT-HDR). You may have a look at them in the meantime.
